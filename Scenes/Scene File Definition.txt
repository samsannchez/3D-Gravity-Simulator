--- 3D Gravity simulator scene file definition 1.0 ---
This type of file stores a universe preset that can be loaded by the Gravity simulator.
The file format definition might change in the future.

Known limitations:
- it doesn't store which body is emissive (it's always the first body in the file by default)
- it doesn't remember which bodies aren't affected by gravity/don't affect others
------------------------------------------------------

First 8 bytes: default scene configuration
- 4 bytes: default G-constant value (float)
- 4 bytes: default timescale (float)

Following bytes: scene bodies. (no padding between each body)
For each body (35 bytes): 
- 3 bytes: body color (3x unsigned byte for R, G, B values)
- 4 bytes: body mass (float)
- 4 bytes: body size (float)
- 4 bytes: body X position (float)
- 4 bytes: body Y position (float)
- 4 bytes: body Z position (float)
- 4 bytes: body X velocity (float)
- 4 bytes: body Y velocity (float)
- 4 bytes: body Z velocity (float)
